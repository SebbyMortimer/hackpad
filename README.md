# Sebby's Hackpad

My personal hackpad for being a power user and probably do something funny. It has 4 buttons, 2 LEDs and an OLED panel.

This is my second time creating a PCB (my first was the "blinky" LED chaser) so I'm still heavily relying on the guide to get me a working macropad, but I was able to add an OLED panel to it with some help from the Hack Club Slack community. I have worked with CAD software a lot in school and we use Autodesk Inventor instead of Fusion 360 so that's why I used Inventor when creating the case, it was a pretty similar process though.

BOM:
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
- 4x MX-Style switches
- 1x 0.91 inch OLED display
- 4x Blank DSA keycaps (White)
- 2x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs
- 4x M3x16mm screws
- 4x M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts
